        "The shift from traditional search to instant AI generated answers carries the promise of a “zero-click” future. Instead of sifting through endless blue links, users will simply ask a question - and get an answer.",
        "And judging by the numbers, consumers are loving life with zero clicks: For example, Perplexity AI is seeing explosive growth, with 100 million weekly queries as of October 2024, compared to 500 million total throughout 2023. ChatGPT, now the 11th most visited site globally,= is expected to launch “SearchGPT“ soon, an answer-focused product similar to Perplexity. And Google isn’t far behind: it’s aggressively rolling out AI Overviews, especially in sectors like healthcare, where AI Answers account for over 50% of results today. Google’s CEO recently referred to the new approach as “Let Google do the Googling for you.”",
        "Here are some future shifts we foresee as AI Answers reshape the way humans discover information.",
        "In a zero-click world, where information is served up without links, humanity could reclaim vast amounts of time. Today, the average Google searcher takes 14.6 seconds to click a link, with about 8 billion daily searches. In a future where AI Answer Engines replace traditional search, the potential time saved by not clicking could reach 32.4 million hours daily. To put it into perspective, that’s nearly the entire Swedish workforce of 5 million people working a full day.",
        "History shows that platform shifts can happen almost overnight. In the early 2000s, Google surged from being half the size of Yahoo to the most-used search engine in two years. In today’s hyper-connected world, it would be dangerous to underestimate just how quickly mainstream adoption of AI Answers will take.",
        "In an AI Answer-driven world, where fewer people click through to websites, why would companies continue publishing content in the same way? Future generations may struggle to grasp the idea of \"websites\" as we know them today. All information - including that from giants like Amazon, Walmart, and Expedia - will likely be absorbed directly into AI applications. This means users could browse, buy, and experience content without ever leaving the AI platform. It’s a vision of seamless, fully integrated browsing.",
        "In a zero-click world, LLMs will serve as gatekeepers, deciding how information is interpreted and presented to users. For marketers, this introduces a new challenge. Instead of influencing consumers through fancy websites, brands will need to optimize their messaging for AI retrieval, hoping the AI accurately relays the original message. AI Optimization tools like Profound will become essential for brands to gauge and refine how frequently - and favorably - they appear in AI Answers.",
        "In this new landscape, real “human made” content will become scarce. In a world filled with endless AI generated “slop”, authentic communities where users share firsthand experiences and insights may become primary information sources for AI retrieval. Investing in platforms like Reddit or X.com could prove strategic as AI Answer Engines increasingly lean on community-sourced knowledge.",
        "Just as social media influencers earn through ad revenue today, the AI platforms of tomorrow may actively commission content from real humans to feed the machine. This shift would transform knowledge sharing into a viable income stream, allowing individuals to profit from producing writing, videos or valuable first-hand information.

        "If you think ChatGPT simply mirrors Google, think again. Here at Profound, we conducted research which shows that ChatGPT's top‐cited sites rarely overlap with Google's top results. This is crucial for brands. Over 400 million people now use ChatGPT weekly, and 60–70% of its answers rely on some form of web retrieval. That means your content needs to shine in both Google's SERP and in ChatGPT's retrieval algorithms, or you risk missing a huge slice of potential traffic.",
        "We tested two queries:",
        "We then compared these ChatGPT results with 200 total Google SERP pulls (100 per query). The overlaps and correlations were startlingly low and sometimes even inverted.",

        "Given that hundreds of millions of people are already tapping ChatGPT weekly, and the model increasingly pulls from real‐time web data, this question has immediate, real‐world implications for marketers and SEO teams.",
        "\"How do I invest in stocks?\"",
        "Takeaway: Google sees sites like E*TRADE and official government pages at the top, while ChatGPT leans more on editorial \"how‐to\" guides or detailed explainer pieces.",
        "\"Best men's running shoes?\"",
        "Takeaway: Google often highlights brand pages and direct purchase links, while ChatGPT cites editorial deep‐dives or \"Top 10\" reviews from specialized running sites. They're almost polar opposites here.",
        "Two Separate \"Search Engines\" Overlaps of 8–12% are extremely low, confirming that ChatGPT effectively runs on different signals than Google. If you dominate Google, don't assume ChatGPT will follow suit.",
        "Commercial Queries Lead to Completely Different Search Results Queries about what to buy, what product is best etc. are drastically different in ChatGPT compared to the traditional Google SERP. This means for brands looking to market in ChatGPT, being mentioned in Google/having a top-ranked product means nothing to ChatGPT.",
        "AI Retrieval ≠ Traditional Ranking ChatGPT's usage of editorial or reference‐style content explains why certain deep‐dive pieces appear frequently even if they barely rank in Google. For the running shoes query, the negative correlation suggests Google's \"brand first\" approach stands in sharp contrast to ChatGPT's preference for extended reviews.",
        "Stakes Are High and Growing With 400M weekly users and a 60–70% web retrieval rate, ChatGPT isn't a niche platform. Failing to optimize for it means losing visibility where a significant portion of internet traffic is seeking answers.",
        "My analysis of over 650 ChatGPT queries and 200 Google SERP queries proves definitively that AI search and traditional SEO content prioritization and ranking factors are completely different. With more than 400 million weekly ChatGPT users actively discovering products and brands through AI, it’s clear that Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the next big channel, one you simply can’t afford to ignore.",

        "OpenAI’s Operator—a vision-powered AI agent that navigates websites like a human—has marketers and web developers buzzing. While headlines focus on its task-automation capabilities (e.g., booking flights, scraping data), a subtler shift is emerging: the birth of SEO optimized for AI agents.",
        "This isn’t about replacing traditional SEO but expanding it. As Operator and rival agents like Google’s Mariner and Anthropic’s Claude proliferate, websites must adapt to serve both humans and AI-driven visitors. Let’s explore why this evolution matters and how to prepare.",
        "Operator’s reliance on visual analysis (screenshots) and reinforcement learning, detailed in OpenAI’s technical overview, exposes a critical flaw in modern web design: most sites are built for humans, not machines. For instance, cluttered layouts or unlabeled buttons (e.g., vague CTAs like “Click Here”) confuse AI agents, leading to task failures. To adapt, websites must prioritize clean semantic HTML, avoiding excessive JavaScript that obscures content, and continue to embrace structured data like schema markup. As noted in OpenAI’s Operator announcement, structured pages help agents identify page intent (e.g., product listings vs. FAQs). Early adopters are also offering public APIs for high-value actions (e.g., bookings), as AI agents increasingly favor direct API integrations over GUI navigation for reliability, per Zapier’s analysis.",
        "Agent-oriented SEO mirrors past evolutions like mobile-first indexing or voice search optimization: don’t get confused, it’s an addition, not a replacement. Just as structured data grew critical for featured snippets without negating meta descriptions, AI-friendly design now complements human-centric UX.",
        "However, Operator’s limitations, (and there are quite a few, task success rates range from 38.1% to 87%, per OpenTools’ benchmarks) highlight the need for hybrid strategies. For example, OpenAI’s Instacart partnership shows how partnering with AI platforms can diversify traffic sources, reducing reliance on volatile organic search.",
        "Imagine a web where 40% of your “visitors” are AI agents like Operator, scraping prices, booking services, or curating personalized workflows for users. Early adopters, such as OpenAI’s partners DoorDash and OpenTable, are already refining AI-friendly interfaces, as TechRepublic reports.",
        "Operator isn’t a finished product but a preview of a web where AI agents are primary users. I’ll leave you with my thoughts: The websites that thrive will speak two languages: one for humans, and one for the AI agents serving them. Start learning both.",
        "Search is one of the most important technologies in the world today. It dictates the exchange of information, powers the flow of capital, and is now, in many ways, humanity's primary source of truth.",
        "It's where we go for anything and everything.",
        "And as marketers are concerned, it's most importantly how people decide what to buy, where to buy it, and what to buy next.",
        "But for the first time since Google brought their blue links to the masses, search is facing major change, and in place of search engines, we now have answer engines.",
        "For nearly 20 years, Google and similar search engines have dominated the way people get answers. Just type a phrase or question, and in return comes a list of webpages with paid links at the top.",
        "Now, though, generative AI is revolutionizing that experience.",
        "No longer are questions met with ranked lists of webpages for people to scroll, click, and hope to use in their quest for answers. Instead, AI answer engines on platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google's AI Overviews are matching custom questions with custom answers, each and every time.",
        "And people are taking notice.",
        "ChatGPT has over 300 million weekly users, and Perplexity is serving over 100 million queries per week. In other words, the generative future is here. And while search isn't disappearing, answer engines are absorbing top and middle funnel queries more quickly than most people realize. Much, much more quickly.",
        "To date, brands have used SEO and SEM strategies to make sure they're included in traditional search results. Tactics like backlinks and keywords have been the focus of entire teams and budgets, because the higher you rank, the more you make.",
        "But now, with the increasing dominance of answer engines, AI Visibility—i.e. your brand's rate of reference in AI-generated answers—is on its way to becoming the new search ranking. And Generative AI SEO, the method for increasing AI Visibility, is a completely different game.",
        "Fortunately, we at Profound have a first-of-its-kind playbook for building a system that continuously improves your brand's visibility in AI-generated responses. It's the process of Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), it works for brands of all types and sizes, and it looks something like this:",
        "Objective: Identify the landscape of AI citations in your industry to learn exactly where, how, and why certain brands are appearing in AI answers.",
        "Key Output: A clear overview of which sources dominate the AI answers in your industry, the content types they produce, and the patterns that lead to higher citation rates—all of which form the basis for your brand's Generative Engine Optimization.",

        "However, the critical insight is now clear: Claude leverages Brave Search as its primary search backend, confirmed by a statistically significant overlap of 86.7% (13 out of 15 total results) between Claude's cited results and Brave Browser's top non-sponsored results.",
        "Claude does not independently crawl the web or retrieve real-time page data directly. Instead, it seems that Claude relies on Brave Search's indexed and cached results. When a query requires fresh content, Claude explicitly conducts a search, shows the search term, and lists underlying results before writing its conversational answer. Citations with direct source links appear inline, similar to ChatGPT.",
        "I ran a detailed analysis of specific queries which revealed remarkably high alignment:",
        "Statistical analysis confirms the observed overlap is far beyond random coincidence (p-value < 0.0001), suggesting Claude directly utilizes Brave's top-ranked organic results without significant re-ranking.",
        "By contrast, ChatGPT, despite using Bing as its backend, shows a much lower alignment of only 26.7% with Bing's top-ranked results. Here's the deal: while you can simply optimize for Claude visibility by targeting Brave, you can't do the same for ChatGPT.",
        "When comparing Claude directly against ChatGPT (powered primarily by Bing), a significant divergence emerges:",
        "Overall, Claude's search results show just 20% overlap with ChatGPT, underscoring substantial differences between Brave-based Claude and Bing-based ChatGPT.",
        "Given Claude's strong alignment with Brave Search's organic rankings, traditional SEO focused on Brave Search becomes the most effective strategy for achieving Claude visibility. Unlike ChatGPT, which shows divergence from its supposed backend, Claude directly reflects Brave's ranking signals:",
        "To enhance visibility in Claude's search ecosystem:",

        "Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the process of ensuring that a brand, product, or service is accurately represented in AI-generated responses on platforms like ChatGPT or Perplexity. By leveraging AEO tools like Profound, brands can understand and influence their visibility in AI-driven answers and effectively strategize for artificial intelligence search engine optimization.",
        "Initially, AI applications like early versions of ChatGPT relied solely on static snapshots of training data up to a certain cutoff date, with no real-time internet connectivity. Brands had little control over how they were represented, as there was no practical way to ensure that their content appeared in the isolated training cycles informing the language model’s knowledge.",
        "However, advancements were rapid, and a new technology emerged: AI Answer Engines, specifically designed as an alternative to traditional search engines. As Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained, AI Answers allow Google to “do the Googling for you.” In this model, users no longer interact directly with the language model; instead, the LLM works behind the scenes to gather and synthesize content from the internet, representing the future of search.",
        "The impact of these AI Answer Engines is expected to be significant. According to a recent Gartner prediction, by 2026, traditional search engine volume will drop 25%, with search marketing losing market share to AI Answer Engines like ChatGPT and Perplexity.",
        "This approach means the AI system performs the search on the user’s behalf, retrieving relevant information and presenting it as a concise, synthesized answer—eliminating the need to sift through multiple search results. This evolution creates new opportunities for brands to focus on the content selected by AI retrieval systems. By optimizing this content, they can influence how favorably and frequently they appear in AI-generated answers, essentially performing SEO for AI search.",
        "As of October 2023, it is estimated that hundreds of millions of daily questions are being answered by AI Answer engines. As more users shift from traditional search engines to AI Answer engines, AEO will increasingly become a vital focus for businesses. The integration of AI in search engines is reshaping the landscape of digital marketing and information retrieval.",
        "Answer Engine Optimization requires a fundamentally different approach than traditional SEO. Brands need tools like Profound to understand and manage how they appear in AI-generated responses. As we witness the evolving role of AI in search engines, it's clear that artificial intelligence optimization and AEO search strategies will play a crucial role in shaping the future of search and brand visibility online.",
        "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on web-based information to perform tasks such as code generation, research assistance, and real-time problem-solving. However, the unstructured nature of HTML content—coupled with limitations in context window size and processing efficiency—poses significant challenges. The llms.txt file emerges as a structured solution to streamline how LLMs access, parse, and utilize web content during inference. This technical specification addresses the gap between human-centric web design and machine-readable data optimization, enabling efficient information retrieval for AI systems.",
        "The llms.txt file is a standardized markdown document hosted at a website’s root path (e.g., https://example.com/llms.txt). It serves as a curated index for LLMs, providing concise summaries of the site’s purpose, critical contextual details, and prioritized links to machine-readable resources. Unlike traditional sitemaps or robots.txt files, which focus on search engine optimization or access control, llms.txt is explicitly designed to optimize LLM inference by reducing noise and surfacing high-value content.",
        "The file follows a strict markdown schema to balance readability for both humans and LLMs while enabling programmatic parsing. Its structure includes an H1 header for the site’s name, a blockquote summarizing its purpose, freeform sections for additional context, and H2-delimited resource lists categorizing links to markdown documents, APIs, or external resources. A reserved ## Optional section flags secondary links that can be omitted when context length is constrained.",
        "For example, a software library’s llms.txt might include a quickstart guide, API references, and troubleshooting tips, while an e-commerce site could highlight product taxonomies, return policies, and inventory APIs. Early adopters like FastHTML and Mintlify demonstrate its versatility, with Mintlify noting in a recent Tweet that “every company will need two versions of their docs: one for humans and another for LLMs.”",
        "One day, every company will need two versions of their docs: one for humans and another for LLMs. Why we made the leap in providing /llms.txt for all customers: mintlify.com/blog/simplifyi…",
        "If your business isn’t adopting llms.txt, you might be actively ceding ground to competitors in a world where AI isn’t the future, but the default. Here’s the rub: LLMs are becoming the primary interface between your customers and your brand. Ignoring this shift is a massive missed opportunity and could threaten your brand's relevance for years to come.",
        "The most innovative companies are designing for an AI-first world. Startups like Cursor and platforms like Tinybird treat LLMs as first-class users, streamlining docs and information into their llms.txt files to ensure their content is picked up, and highlighted to the user in an AI's answer. If your documentation, policies, or product details aren’t machine-retrievable, you’re functionally invisible to the growing ecosystem of AI answer engines, coding copilots, and research tools that millions already rely on.",
        "Without llms.txt, LLMs will still scrape your site—but they’ll do it poorly. They’ll make mistakes navigating your pages, miss the most relevant information, misinterpret pricing tiers, or prioritize the wrong pages. When a developer asks, “How do I integrate with your API?” and the LLM serves an old example from 2018, that’s your brand’s credibility burning.",
        "The next generation of buyers doesn’t Google—they ask. They’re prompting ChatGPT to compare your pricing against rivals, having GPT-4o draft code using your docs, or asking Claude how to troubleshoot your hardware. If your content isn’t in the ## Docs section of an llms.txt file, your brand and your narrative will not be found. As Mintlify warned, dual-format docs are essential in a world where a massive portion of website visitors will be AI agents.",
        "LLMs have limited attention spans. If your critical info is buried in a 10,000-word HTML page with cookie banners and SEO jargon, it’ll get truncated. llms.txt I like to think of llms.txt as a triage system. It tells LLMs, “Prioritize this, ignore that.” Fail to provide it, and your differentiators (unique APIs, return policies, compliance details) get lost in the token budget.",
        "During inference, LLMs or their orchestration frameworks (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation systems) parse llms.txt to identify relevant data sources. The process involves three stages. First, the LLM fetches /llms.txt to determine the site’s scope and extract prioritized URLs, bypassing inefficient HTML crawling. Second, linked markdown files—hosted at predictable URLs (e.g., appending .md to HTML paths)—are retrieved and processed. These files omit extraneous elements like navigation menus or ads, providing clean, focused content. Third, based on the query’s context window constraints, the system includes or excludes resources flagged as Optional.",
        "For instance, when a developer asks an LLM, “How do I handle HTTP errors in FastHTML?” the model might parse https://docs.fastht.ml/llms.txt, locate the ## Docs section, fetch linked markdown files like error_handling.md, and generate a response using the structured documentation. This approach avoids sifting through less relevant HTML pages, as highlighted by Jeremy Howard, who spearheaded the llms.txt proposal: “Constructing the right context for LLMs based on a website is ambiguous—site authors know best.”",
        "To illustrate, consider a hypothetical llms.txt file for Nike:",
        "This file directs LLMs to technical product details, policies, and optional historical context. A customer query like “What eco-friendly materials are in Nike’s running shoes?” would trigger retrieval of the sustainability.md and running.md files, bypassing marketing-heavy HTML pages.",
        "The llms.txt standard complements existing web protocols. While robots.txt governs crawler permissions and sitemap.xml lists indexable pages, llms.txt directly addresses LLMs’ need for preprocessed, hierarchical data. Early adopters include open-source projects like FastHTML and companies such as Tinybird, which noted in a Tweet that their docs now serve “food for the robots who help you write your code.” Directories like directory.llmstxt.cloud curate implementations, fostering ecosystem growth.",
        "Adoption involves three steps: authoring the file using the schema, generating markdown equivalents for existing content (tools like nbdev automate this), and validating structure with parsers like llms_txt2ctx. For instance, OpenPipe streamlined its docs by hosting llms.txt and llms-full.txt, ensuring fine-tuning models access clean data.",
        "To future-proof content delivery for LLM-driven interactions:",
        "As the LLMs.txt Directory highlights, adoption is accelerating across industries—from AI startups to enterprise platforms. By providing deterministic access to machine-friendly data, llms.txt reduces latency, improves accuracy, and positions organizations at the forefront of the LLM-optimized web.",
        "Act now: Start with a minimal llms.txt file, link your most critical documentation, and iterate based on LLM performance. The era of AI-native content delivery is here.",
        "Today, an estimated 200-300 million daily queries are handled by Answer Engines like ChatGPT or Perplexity and it doesn’t show any signs of slowing down. Consumers love AI Answers because they save time and reduce the pain of decision making.",
        "And as the world witnessed in the past with previous shifts like digital, mobile and social, AI Search is shaping up as an ‘adapt or die’ ultimatum for any brand that relies on web traffic.",
        "This isn’t a problem that can be kicked down the road, this change is happening right now - with folks already reporting a decline in traffic. And it seems like it will only continue to intensify; a recent Gartner report states: \"By 2028 brands’ organic search traffic will decrease by 50% or more as consumers embrace generative AI-powered search\".",
        "Right now is the time for brands to start monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing their content for AI Search. Much like SEO in 1992, the players that get ahead now will reap the benefits for years to come.",
        "To illustrate the importance of AI Search Strategy, let’s look at an example of a consumer using ChatGPT to research running shoes:",
        "As you can see, the user is presented with multiple product recommendations, each with supporting rationale.",
        "Unlike traditional search, ChatGPT synthesizes nuance to give better, more relevant answers; accounting for the running distance, the user’s gender and even the inferred request for additional arch support. ChatGPT also memorizes key points which will be stored and used for context in future searches.",
        "At a glance, this new search format may seem inconsequential to brands, but look again and ask: where is Nike? As you can see, ChatGPT did not suggest a single product from Nike - a company that spends $4bn per year on marketing (footwear being their #1 category).",
        "For Nike executives, this is a critical issue. For every other marketing executive, it highlights a nascent opportunity created by AI Search.",
        "A thoughtful AI Search Strategy is the antidote. By establishing a continuous feedback loop with the Answer Engines, brands can ensure content is optimized for LLM training and retrieval (RAG) systems, resulting in more frequent and favorable citations in AI Search.",
        "This is the problem we are solving at Profound, the first dedicated platform to help enterprise brands monitor, analyze, and optimize their AI Search results.",
        "Profound interrogates AI Search platforms with millions of questions daily to understand how your brand is being represented and then uses a proprietary algorithm to suggest improvements.",
        "Reach out to [email protected] if you are interested in improving how your brand shows up in AI Search.",
        "You’ve heard of ChatGPT, a chatbot that can answer questions. AI agents take it further. They don’t just say which CRM is best; they can log into five different CRMs, create accounts, and test workflows, all on a user’s behalf. If your competitor’s platform is easier for agents to navigate, you’ll miss that sale without even knowing it.",
        "A chatbot stops after giving an answer. An agent moves on to do something about it: filling forms, comparing prices, or scheduling demos. That’s why in “Introducing AX: Why Agent Experience Matters,” Netlify CEO Mathias Biilmann says we must build products that agents can “use.” If your docs, APIs, or sign-in flow confuse an agent, it’ll choose a simpler path.",
        "Years ago, lacking a website made you invisible. Then came APIs, which developers demanded to integrate your product. Now, agents are that next wave. They’re not just scanning your site; they’re using it. If your platform doesn’t load quickly, lacks structured info, or forces complicated sign-ups, the agent bails… and so does its user.",
        "Picture a busy CFO: she tells her AI agent, “Find me a new invoicing tool and set up a free trial.” The agent scans five options, tries to sign up for each, and sees where it hits roadblocks. If your platform has a four-step sign-up with hidden fields or unclear docs, the agent moves on. You lose the CFO’s business without a single human conversation.",
        "According to Imperva, almost half of all internet traffic isn’t human. Agents will keep growing, and they act. If you’re not AX-friendly, these digital power users will ignore you. That’s a lost sale, a missed lead, or a user who never sees your brand.",
        "Chatbots simply advise. Agents do. Lean into AX by making your site a place agents love to use. It isn’t complicated: machine-friendly docs, a quick sign-up, and real-world testing are your keys. As Biilmann warns: “Platforms, tools, or frameworks that are hard for large language models to use will start feeling less powerful.” So make it easy, or watch your competitors do it first.",

        "At Profound, we've discovered a fundamental insight: directly monitoring consumer-facing AI search engines delivers radically different results than querying static LLM APIs. While today's leading AI platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Copilot all use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to access real-time information about your brand, the method of querying APIs directly misses this dynamic landscape entirely. This article reveals why tracking the actual AI search engines consumers use—rather than their underlying APIs—provides the only accurate window into your brand's AI presence, delivering intelligence that can transform your digital strategy.",
        "When a system only queries LLM by directly calling APIs, it's limited by the historical data that the model was trained on. Popular LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude have significant built-in constraints:",
        "Outdated Information (Knowledge Cutoff): These models are trained on historical data up to a specific cutoff (e.g., mid-2023). Any subsequent developments—like new product launches, rebranding efforts, or PR crises—simply aren't captured, leading to outdated or incorrect information when queried months or years later.",
        "Context Window Limitations: The model's context window (8K-32K tokens) severely restricts the volume of updated information that can be injected into a prompt, making comprehensive updates impractical for brands with extensive, rapidly evolving content.",

For instance, a question about recent AI developments gets broken down into specific search terms like \"AI breakthroughs 2025\", \"artificial intelligence developments 2025\". This is often done using a smaller, faster model optimized for keyword generation.",
        "Index Lookup and URL Selection: Instead of directly using search API results, the system queries a web index to get potential relevant URLs. A smaller model then evaluates these URLs based on their metadata and snippets to determine which ones are most likely to contain relevant information—similar to how a human would scan search results before clicking on the most promising links.",
        "Real-time Crawling and Content Processing: The system then performs real-time crawling of the selected URLs, much like a human would click and read the most relevant pages. This crawled content goes through several processing steps:",

OpenAI is expected to implement similar techniques for their O1/O3 models in ChatGPT, while Google is rumored to incorporate comparable features with Gemini 2.0 flash-thinking model. The success of DeepSeek's implementation suggests we're seeing the emergence of a new standard in AI capabilities.",
        "What makes DeepSeek R1's implementation particularly fascinating is its unprecedented transparency in reasoning while incorporating web search. For the first time in a consumer-facing product, users can actually observe how an AI model thinks through problems and makes decisions using real-time web information.",
        "When R1 responds to a query, it doesn't just provide an answer—it shows its entire thought process. Users can see exactly why the model chose certain sources over others, how it evaluates the credibility of information, and how it arrives at its conclusions. This transparency has struck a chord with users and industry leaders alike.",
        "DeepSeek search feels more sticky even after a few queries because seeing the reasoning (even how earnest it is about what it knows and what it might not know) increases user trust by quite a lot",

        "This combination of web search with visible reasoning traces creates a new level of user trust and engagement. When users can follow the model's logic—seeing how it handles uncertainties, acknowledges limitations, and builds arguments—they develop a better understanding of and confidence in the AI's responses. It's like having a transparent partner in research rather than a black box that simply spits out answers.",
        "We expect this trend of transparent reasoning to accelerate across the industry. As companies like OpenAI and Google work to integrate web search into their reasoning models, they're likely to follow DeepSeek's lead in exposing the thinking process to users. This shift towards transparency could fundamentally change how we interact with AI systems, making them more trustworthy and educational tools rather than just answer engines.",

        "Josh is our leading AI strategist and overall AEO expert at Profound. Nigel is the founder of Organic Growth Marketing, and then Garrett is director of marketing at iPoll, Rink. And today, really, all we're trying to do is go in and just unpack the big announcement from Google, talk about AI mode, just kind of set the stage of, first of all, what is it, and then going into some more tactical questions of where do we go from here?",
        "What do we do? Are we panicking about clicks falling off a cliff or not? That kind of stuff. so first I'll kick it over to Josh to kind of just give us an overview of what is Google AI mode? How does it work? What are your early thoughts on it? And we can go from there.",
        "Absolutely. Yeah. think Google AI mode, mean, all right, let's start at the very beginning. You Google's got the Google AI overviews that appears on, you know, around 13 % of queries if we're doing the math. Um, but AI mode is the extension of that functionality, which is an actual full fledged AI chat bot experience. If you click the little AI mode button in the left-hand side of your browser, you're entered into a chat and that chat is going to converse with you and you're going to find everything from, um,",
        "an integration with Google maps to Google shopping. And you're to be able to go and get resources, discuss things. mean, it really is. I think in my perspective right now, the interesting thing about AI mode for me, my like immediate thought when I saw it was like, boom, okay, this is the BC to AD moment that Google has finally admitted that like, okay, search is conversational. We're doing this. It's going to conversational search is the future. Cause I think people, I think people don't have a healthy appreciation that like this is",
        "Yes, it is kind of like a pseudo experiment, but it's also not one of like the quirky little Google labs experiments. This is a feature of Google. Now this is part of the Google experience is a conversational mode of search. And I don't think we're going back anytime soon.",
        "Great. Yeah, Nigel, I would love your kind of take on the state of things. And then Garrett, I'll send it to you. And then we'll go into some kind of rapid fire questions.",
        "Cool, thanks Nick guys. I told you in the lead up to this, I'm gonna say it depends in a whole bunch of different ways here. so I think the first thing like when we really think about it, when a lot of questions are here are gonna be about what can we expect, what's gonna happen. So I think it's important to say what are the variables here? Like besides what we assume, what do we actually know and not know? Like so right now AI mode is an option. When is it going to become the default? How is this going to evolve over time?",
        "One little hypothesis I have is actually that search is moving in a direction where if it used to be just Google traditional search, you now have the surface area expanded. It's multiple LLMs, it's social, it's video. And now even within Google, is there a world where there's a generational gap where older, less tech savvy people just don't want to use this and Google sort of has to find a way to appease them? I'm not saying that's going to happen. I'm just saying, I don't know. And then how is this product going to be adopted? How are people going to like it?",
        "How is that going to influence their behavior? Like the overarching theme here that everyone can see is search is moving more conversational. So if we want to say, where is it going to be in a few years? I can sort of predict that with higher confidence than what's happening next week, next month, over the next year. If everyone remembers when SGE first was trialed at Google IO two years ago, there was this huge panic of, my God, look at these screenshots. What do they mean? And then that experience changed a lot and nothing actually changed for a little while.",
        "I'm not saying nothing's going to change. We're already seeing the change from search. But again, the point being, if the question is, is the sky falling from Google AI mode? I think the answer to that for me is no. But what is the overall trend here? We're shifting paradigms. The old paradigm of Google is we organize all the world's information. You ask the question, we find the page that best answers it. We're now moving to, we've read all the information and how do we summarize it? And that is such a fundamentally different way to think about search, that it changes the way we measure.",
        "the strategy, what we know, what we don't know, and all of that. So, and I think Garrett will touch on this too, but we're kind of moving into a stage where SEO becomes less of this, okay, we know the levers to pull, you make the content, you build the links, you get the traffic, you get the conversions, watch, repeat, and a much more of like uncertainty and bets where we can say, okay, here's what we see now, here's what we think is gonna happen, we think this will make sense, we'll try to measure it this way.",
        "So for me, it is both uncertain and very, very fun. And I'm not really taking anything for granted and all bets are off. But yeah, that's my blurb.",
        "Garrett, how do you feel about that?",
        "Yeah, it's funny. There's a lot of overlap with Nigel. We're going to have our like strong, you know, polarizing opinions. And yet I totally align in the sense of, you know, going back historically timeline of chat GPT comes out late 2022. That summer we get SGE Google feels they have to be on the reactive. They've been controlling the narrative all around. You have to always go back to the money. Like how's advertising? What role is that going to play in all this? And then there is this",
        "shift in paradigms, the fact of in Google I.O. along with the AI mode, we have this release of this idea of personal context. So nobody gets the same answers anymore. More and more AI mode is able to take into consideration everything that Google knows about you in the Google ecosystem. So what you see as a result of a search is going to be different than what I see as the result of a search. And that's going to make our jobs as marketers, as SEO significantly more different.",
        "and more difficult, Nigel mentioned like kind of the paradigm shift of how we approach this. Like as SEOs in the past, we've been so focused on targeting a specific query, but we've also seen this idea of this fan out where now with the LLM, it can actually predict all the different relevant and reformulated queries that are related to what you're actually searching for. So it's pulling from content that we have to parse out and reverse engineer.",
        "Which makes our job more difficult the other aspect of this is now this point is like nothing is gonna change immediately the difference between AI mode and AI Overviews is AI overviews was put front and center. It's very disruptive. You can't opt out of it It was right in front of you as you see, you know first five eight ten percent of queries would have this experience where all of a sudden you're not seeing the ten blue links you're seeing this generative",
        "response right now out of the gate. were just talking about before this where even those technically been rolled out. We're not seeing it on just a normal search. see it on our labs where we've opted into like a special experiment mode, but we're not seeing it public. so right now it's just a tab where there's still that friction where you have to switch from the traditional search results to the AI mode. And until it becomes the default, which I think it will, like Nigel said, you know, we'll talk about when that runway is.",
        "it's not going to have that disruptive experience quite yet.",
        "Yeah, I think that's what's been interesting to me is that Google said it was going to roll out to everyone. And then all four of us tried to find it right before we went live. And it's not live for any of us right now, which is interesting to me. I think some of the chatter I saw online immediately is there's always the both sides. But I saw the panic about a drop in click volume to publishers, to any content creators on the web. And I'm kind of curious what y'all's take is.",
        "on this of until the full rollout happens, until it's kind of like in your face like AI overviews is. I wouldn't personally expect a massive decline in clicks. A lot of publishers are seeing declines in clicks already and impressions increasing. But would love y'all's take on when and if we'll see a decline in clicks and how dramatic that drop is going to be. Josh, I'll start with you.",
        "Yeah. mean, here's, here's what I think. I think it's a total lever of the adoption. like if, if 20 % of people, like, you know, AI overviews is on 13 % of queries. People are talking about the 30 % decrease in CTR from AI overviews. a well-known kind of well-cited stat. I think if you see even 10 % of searches going through AI mode, which would be drastically a lot, like to me, that would be like pretty solid adoption from Google. 10 % of people actually.",
        "Opting into jumping into a second tab to have a more personalized experience. think, um, you know, I think the CTR is gonna, it's gonna undergo the same effect. I think we're going to see like that 20, 30 % decline in CTRs. Um, if not like totally punished within the, like the conversational experience. I think the interesting thing to see within AI mode is going to be the actual conversion rate. So within AI overviews.",
        "You've got this kind of like one shot answer, really a lot of discussion. There's really no discussion to be had. There's really no way to kind of drill down and have that full conversation. But what we know from ChatGVT already is that the leads coming from ChatGVT and coming from these chat interfaces are much warmer. I've got experiential insights from brands that saying, we're seeing 25%, 30 % conversion rates on referrals from ChatGVT. That's great. mean, that's, to anyone who knows anything about conversion rates from referral traffic, that's a nutty.",
        "And to have it from one channel in such a unified way, I mean, that's sending a strong signal. Now with AI mode, can we guarantee the same kind of high quality traffic pipeline? You're going to see the same thing. think that's a huge question. I'm pretty bullish on that. think AI mode is going to lead to some really high converting, high intent traffic coming into websites. And I think websites really need to start thinking about,",
        "Are they going to be able to route those people the correct way? Are they going to be able to have experiences that just get them ready to take action, jump in there, make the purchase if they're already ready, if they've been through all the informational phases?",
        "Yeah, but before I joined Profound, I was consulting for SaaS companies. And I've got access to a lot of HubSpot accounts. And every single one of my clients had deals that were sourced from ChatGPT. The biggest one was a chunky six-figure ARR deal, or referral source was very cleanly equal to ChatGPT, which is crazy. And I think that'll only continue as like this, the rollout happens.",
        "Nigel and Gar, I'm kind of curious on that too. I saw that for AI mode that there is no refer information kind of being passed through right now. And so are y'all optimistic that that'll change and or that we'll see some of that data in Search Console anytime soon?",
        "No, no shot. not seeing a Google Search. No, I mean, like there was talk about whether or not the referral stripping was apparently a bug, which has potentially since been rectified, but not really. I don't anticipate any sort of insights in Google Search Console, even though it makes sense. We've heard talks about like ads getting insights into what queries were used that will ultimately send traffic via AI mode.",
        "What I'll say to your click question though is I think we need to reframe the way we're thinking about clicks and content in general. It's not, not that it's become a vanity metric, but the type of traffic that's going to come to your website and Josh kind of touched on this, isn't going to be from that like informational content anymore. Like we have a responsibility to provide information about our businesses and insights that will get them there of like why they choose us. There'll be entertainment factors through other channels.",
        "But just doing the old like AI slop top of the funnel content, it's like, why do they need a business to do that? And so thinking about the, where the clicks come from, the other aspect of it is like how the UX plays out. Like we're already seeing different iterations, which I don't envy Josh's job. And you guys have profound of like, how do you track all of this? Because you're seeing different types of links. Like you're seeing little cards, you're seeing carousels, you're seeing links that go to other Google searches.",
        "The whole reporting and tracking of all this is a completely different type of challenge in the first place. So I think ultimately the way we attribute all this is going to require a lot of untangling of messiness. Everything's going to continue to be really messy.",
        "Yeah. Plus one on all that. And even when we talk about concepts, like I think like click through rate is even that's like a concept from a previous paradigm that like borderline doesn't really apply. But another note, we kind of have one foot in the old world and one foot in the new world right now. So we've been talking to our customers about, like we still get some traffic and stuff from Google. Certain things work for that. And then we have this new LLM stuff and AI mode. And how do we handle like",
        "both of these together. So I think that's what we're all figuring out. then as far as, mean, I would not count on Google telling us anything. Will they maybe tell us something? Yeah, but just when you think about it from like a big picture and common sense perspective, if Google already strips a lot of queries out of Search Console, like Search Console is not close to as helpful as it used to be back in the day when it was Webmaster Tools. So like, and if that's partially because queries are getting more personalized and even now a bunch of them get stripped away like,",
        "Say goodbye to all that. Like our best chance is going to be, I don't know, browser plugins, all the weird things. And even then that's only going to be a slice of it. We're probably going to have to go towards more qualitative research to start to understand, okay, who are our customers? And this sounds like a very cliche thing, but I do believe it. Like who are our customers and what are their problems and how do they think versus keyword research tools kind of approach.",
        "I mean, yeah, I mean, like in this, in this paradigm, like what is a keyword, right? Like I think Google and, and chat GPT open AI, if they want to, if open AI wants to introduce an ads model, it's like, okay, I submitted my 10 paragraph query with like three pictures and like a CSV file. What's the keyword? All right. Like, go ahead. Like, what's the keyword? Like, what, like if I'm a brand, how do I optimize for it? Right. Where am I going to put my money?",
        "So I think there's something that like here at Profound, we're also thinking about that question too, right? So we're always trying to model keyword volume and things like that. If you know anything about the platform, you know, we've got this awesome keyword volume tool that's coming to the works. But I think there's this place where we're going to kind of meet halfway on that. And I think that the actual model providers and the folks that are doing the generative experiences are going to have to start thinking critically about how do we decide what the unit is? Like, what is the unit? Like, are we talking about?",
        "Is it like an answer thing? we, do we, does it, you know, is it about query regularization? Do I read in your query and turn it into one of 16.7 million standard queries that exists somewhere else that we can like think are like almost just like a fixed basket. Is it about like fixed answers? Does every answer have like a unique code with it? I don't know, but I think if, if we were going to still think critically and run tests on this stuff, it's, it's going to have to be solved.",
        "So there are plenty of things about that area that are still yet to be decided even by the people who make the models and make the systems.",
        "What role do you think citations have? Are citations kind of the new rankings now, a big brand like Figma or something might really care a lot that their perspective on design systems and design operations is kind of what surfaced in these responses from AI tools? so what role do you think citations play, having this kind of new mode of AI search? And if you're free, any of y'all to answer.",
        "I'm to throw one out there, not to monopolize it, but I think, I think there's like three things about citations. think citations themselves are like, they're a means to a different end, which is like ultimate brand visibility in the risk, like being in the paragraph. Like citations are the way that you claw your way into being the first bullet point in the list of running shoes that, you know, AI mode or chat to BT recommends. Citations are also a way that you can influence the content of that answer itself.",
        "Right? So you can, you can try to shape, you know, what are the factors? What are the features that are being described? Hopefully to try to highlight things that are most important to the customer, most detailed, you know, things like that. I think the third thing is just like this idea of like, maybe something wider than citations, like almost like informed, like informed queries. Like I want to inform the queries. I might care about being in the paragraph. I might care about being the resource.",
        "You know, there are some brands out there, at least some that we work with here Profound who are like, I don't really care about being in the paragraph. I just really want to show my, you know, I run an ads model and a lot of my revenue comes from other companies paying us. I want to show that I'm still relevant in, you know, in search, in generative search. want, you know, brands when they come to us to say, to be able to say, yeah, we are one of the top sources in generative AI. You should still consider spending some money with us, placing some ads with us, putting some content out on our site.",
        "because we're still relevant and we're still being cited and our content still sets a benchmark for some of these queries. So I think there is this kind of share of query of like, how do you, how do you decide what's more valuable? I think it also contextualizes into the brand's goals, but I think basically it comes down to this hopefully eventually quantitative, but right now very qualitative idea of like influence, just like this big kind of question mark of like, what is influence? How do you measure it? How do you care about it?",
        "And how does it go down to the bottom line, which is revenue?",
        "I completely agree with Josh. And one thing I want to call out too is we really need to distinguish the difference between AI mode and chat GPT. Like open AI is not a search engine first. Like that's not how they're built. Google 100 % is built as a search engine. So the way they think about using citations as trust signals is not going to be the same as open AI. And maybe over time chat GPT becomes that. So in the context of this call,",
        "Citations still matter, but we do need to also expand two ideas. One is rankings are different. Like it's really not just about being number one. I think it's a general visibility thing because when we try going back to this probabilistic sort of answers and personal context, if I ask for the best bank for me, I'm going to get different answers from than Joshua and Nigel will. And I'm definitely not going to get it in the same order.",
        "So like how useful is it to know who was the first list of the second list of the third list? And I just want to make sure that I am visible in most of the answers for the greatest group of people. That's my target audience. The other aspect of it is because like we're talking chat GBT citations, we don't know how much they ultimately matter outside of, know, Josh's point of influencing the content is the mentions. Like it's not just necessarily the links, but is your brand just specifically mentioned?",
        "in other content, know, stepping away from the trust signals because usually the link was the vote. Now it's just like making sure that your brand is associated with content relevant to whatever the topic someone's searching for.",
        "Is there a world where you optimize for chat GPT and that's different than how you optimize for AI overviews? Or AI mode?",
        "GBT, the rag model of chat GBT is made by academic. That's like an academic thing. Like engineers treat it like it's like optimizing cash. Like how's the performance of it? Google knows what like SEOs do. Like I think, I think chat GBT is a little bit naive. not in like a bad way or anything. It's like, I wouldn't expect them to like be, and I wouldn't want them to be considerate of like all of us, like over-optimizers. all said in the best way, but like, I, I do expect.",
        "which actually be, and it was totally natural that they're the signals for their ranking are just much more utility based. It's like, does the content like, don't care. It could be from this random spammy domain, but does the content answer the question? So yeah, I think, I think things are going to be, I think things are going to continue to bifurcate. But one other thing I'll throw, like I'll throw kind of a coin into the blender here is the, the deprecation of the thing API.",
        "That's going to be huge, right? That's going to change the whole game. Like where is Chastity BT going to go? Are we going to see this like flattening? Are we going to go on team Google? Is Google going to be open to a partnership or are we going to do our own thing with that OAI search bot, that index bot that they've been building? So diligently this whole time, maybe we're doing something else. I don't know.",
        "Since we're almost halfway, I do want to kick it to a question that Alex asked in the beginning. Alex asks, what geotactic strategies have been most effective for your clients? Any unexpected insights? Garrett or Nigel, I'll kind of let y'all go first. And I know Josh has a perspective on this too.",
        "One of y'all answer, please.",
        "to monetize, you monopolize. wanted to let Nigel have the shot, but I mean, I think it goes back to the original, GEO study, which is what we experiment a lot with, which is a combination of citations, facts, authoritative language, and then, mirroring the sort of tone of the potential queries. The other big thing for us is reverse engineering, especially like this is our focus for AI overviews and for,",
        "AI mode is what's been described as the fan out, the query fan out, which is trying to identify, like originally when SGE came out and AI overviews came out, people were confused of like, why is an article that's not ranking in the top 100 for this query showing up in the AI overview? And then we realized they were doing a reformulated related query fan out exactly sort of format. And so now it's a process of trying to identify, and we have some proprietary techniques of identifying like.",
        "what that fan out entails. Because you can see it work with AI mode. You can see six different searches, 100 different websites. And so we're reverse engineering that and identifying what those queries are and then creating content that's hyper relevant. One last thing I'll say is focusing on Google and Chachipiti use Fraggles, very specific passages, and look for extreme relevance in terms of",
        "what's called vector embeddings, where you turn words into mathematical values, and then you identify what's called the cosine similarity, which is how mathematically relevant is this paragraph to what someone is searching for? And so that's kind of our scientific mathematical approach for very specific queries.",
        "I'd add like on a very simple level when you're doing like SEO, GEO, whatever for brands, historically we have to look at the incentives. At Google it was like, well, this is where the search volume is, therefore we care about doing the things that will rank here. Now we can kind of go to first principles and say, okay, if people can ask very specific questions, what are the specific questions that we feel we are best suited to, like that are gonna drive the most value for the business? So if it's a product, then it used to be,",
        "What are all the like clear scope keywords that'll get us ranking now could be, okay, what are the things where we think we win deals and how do we make sure that we are specifically mentioning those and also thinking about what are the ways people self identify? So just like a hypothesis, but if the way people are using LLMs to search is more, it's not best CRM. It's, hey, I work at a 10 person multi-franchise pizza shop in Cincinnati. We have this and this integration. We have this much revenue. Here's how many orders we get.",
        "We have to send texts and like we have a newsletter. Here's what we're trying to do. So you can think about, okay, what are all the verticals that we want to be across times the integrations and all those sorts of things. And how do we put out a signal? And I think the advantage you can have here is like how many pages are there on the internet that say we can solve this vertical and we have these products and we solve these use cases. It doesn't mean you have to include every single possible variation, but",
        "Like I've seen like it's still early enough that I don't feel very confident saying, yeah, we've solved GEO. It's do this and this and this thing. But if very simply, when you have a specific page, it can be relevant for a specific question. And now we're thinking about how do we do this at scale in a way that still makes sense and isn't sloppy.",
        "That's awesome. I love that. I think the man, there's so many little interesting things here. one of my favorite little insights right now, and I want to go back to what you said, Garrett, because that, mean, that's the name of the game, right? Like right now I'm obsessed about, like, I don't care what you put into the chat box window. I care about what the chat box says you put in the chat box window. I don't care about the seven paragraph query. I care. Like have I go",
        "Yeah, I want to go to like a hot yoga studio and I want to go to one that's open at seven in the morning and I've never done it before. So I'm a little nervous. And is there one that's like 15 minutes from my neighborhood? That'd be really great. And it'd be like, yeah, okay. Hot yoga studio, Brooklyn, like early morning. Boom. That's the fucking, that's the query. that's the query though, that you're optimizing towards. So, I mean, what, what you end up trying to have to go back down to is, you know, how does that system work? Can you model that system?",
        "How differentiated is that across users? think one of the coolest insights right now is that for ChatGPT's query regularizer, technically the word is regularize, it regularizes the queries, it'll add 2025 to the end of many, many queries, leading to, stunningly, the situation where pages that have 2025 in the URL slug and pages that have 2025 in the title tag end up ranking better.",
        "Is that the way it's going to be forever? No, but that's what happens when, you know, PhDs build like search systems because yeah, that performs great at getting great, fresh insights and information. But now I'm absolutely going to put 2025 in my URL selects. Why not? I'll take the extra 2 % citation rate.",
        "And to that point, that's another way you got to realize the differentiator between chat GPT and open AI very much chat GPT. They're both like wild, wild West. And Nigel has been joking, you know, like everything is, it depends at this point, but like there's so much of the old school search engine manipulation you can do for chat GPT that Google's already ahead of it. they're so obsessed with, you know, spam, like, you know, we joke about the whole idea of like white text on a white background, like",
        "that would probably work on chat GPT right now. I think AI mode is gonna catch that sort of stuff. The other consideration, man, there's so many different directions that we can go in. Josh, we're talking about agentic models and the focus of that is a whole other consideration of at what point are we no longer trying to show up for people, but for their own personalized LLMs or their personalized agents.",
        "But one other thing I'll call out from a practical standpoint is being hyper aware of your JavaScript implementation because you are also dependent on crawlers going to your website and being able to surface your content. so, you know, a lot of these chat bot crawlers don't necessarily render JavaScript and they can't get it. And so then it's invisible. So that's like one of the simplest things I would say, regardless right now.",
        "you need to make sure that your content is accessible by these bots, regardless of what type they are.",
        "It's the smartest people in the world. It stops at JavaScript. We're not crawling the JavaScript.",
        "Do you all have perspectives? know Josh does, but I'm mostly like Garrett and Nigel of LLMs.txt. To my understanding, most crawlers aren't really using this yet. But from my perspective, it kind of just makes intuitive sense to serve up your content in a way that's easiest for these unsophisticated crawlers that prioritize the current year anywhere in the content or in the slug right now. What do you all think of LLMs.txt overall right now? And how should people be thinking about it?",
        "I mean, I'll give a quick answer, which is that it's not that hard to do. I'm not very optimistic that anytime super soon, it's going to make that much of a difference, but it is also pretty early with all this stuff. I don't know. mean, yeah. To your point, Nick, the core concept of how do we give LLMs content in a way that they can easily consume? That makes a ton of sense. What way actually works like right now and will work is still a bit TBD in my experience.",
        "Yeah, I'm with Nigel. It's really hard to get standardization across the entire internet for like a certain industry. If it happens, it happens. Like we can't even decide on what we're calling GEO, AEO, LLMO, let alone like using an LMS.txt type of protocol.",
        "That said, do think, know, we in the SEO where we used to joke about structured data, like not having any actual valuable applications or results other than like, you little star ratings. will say structured data and making sure that your content is in the various knowledge and shopping graphs will continue to grow in importance. So just making sure that you have your information is structured and easily consumable goes back to the JavaScript thing.",
        "for these bots is going to be critical for businesses.",
        "Sweet. I'm going go back to a question. This one's kind of long. So I'll read out the most important part, and y'all probably will just see the big shout out to Josh in the beginning. Do you guys think that Google will segment AI search out from organic for improved tracking? My uneducated take on this is I think everything will just move to AI mode. think Google Search as we know it is not going to be around for much longer, but would love your guys' take.",
        "I don't know, it'll be interesting to see. One day it'll be like, you'll have to opt into serp. I want to opt into the serp. I don't know. I think eventually, I think these things are gonna flatten at a midpoint, basically. I think there is gonna be an element of still serpiness. I think we're very far on the pendulum swing of conversation. I think it'll be conversation plus serp with a little bit of explainability. Maybe, I don't know, I like to think that there's always gonna be a synthesis between two of these points.",
        "Yeah, to that point, think like multimodality, like the goal. think the future state of all this stuff is reducing as much friction as possible. You know, in the past, we've always had to adjust our natural behavior for the technology because the technology was limited. You think perfect examples keywords, right? Like we used to put in a very simple keyword because the search engines didn't understand the nuance of natural language. And, you know, with the natural language processing, bird, mom, and the advancements there, we feel more comfortable asking the full",
        "a question with context, it's going to continue to get more advanced. And we think about using audio, video, text, like whatever is going to be the best way to search in that specific, for that specific question is going to be the way we do it. You look at what they announced beyond with live search and Project Astra at Google IO using videos to, you know, find out information. And ultimately, if we're thinking real future down the line, like search won't be its own thing.",
        "it'll just won't be the core function of what our assistant is. It'll just be something that's naturally a function of however we interact with our day to day, like the movie Her, like will be, it's basically a thing.",
        "Yeah, to me, the only uncertainty is like, again, like how long does it take us to get from here to there? Like when I think about my parents or extended family that's outside of like our tech bubble, it's like, are they, yeah, like when this gets shoved down their throat, are they like, how are they going to respond? And I don't know. That's what makes me a little less certain on the time horizon of all this. Like, it surprise me if the UX got cleaned up very beautiful, everyone uses it, they're forced to, and it's more useful? Yes.",
        "But it also wouldn't surprise me if this took a while. Think about people in your life who really learned how to properly use Google in the last five years and how long has it been around. So that's the only thing that gives me a bit of hesitation around trying to predict the timeline of the future. Whereas I totally agree with the conclusion of where we're going.",
        "Yeah, I this gives me hope that like my parents Alexa is finally going to work for them. I mean, I hope it, I hope if it, if if the intelligence increases, they'll finally be able to do things, know, in depth, agentically. I know I'm thinking about, I think voice is actually kind of underrated for those kinds of use cases, like non-technical use cases where like, I don't know if you've tried chat GPT's voice dictation. It's phenomenal. I use chat GPT's voice dictation more than I use like my Mac. Like I go to chat GPT to get the voice dictation from chat GPT.",
        "to then go put into Gemini 2.5 Pro. That's how much I like their voice dictation. I think voice is underrated. I there's gonna be a lot of ways to interface with that. I wanna use an LLM in my car. I wanna have it like order me like a birthday cake and send invites to my friends in my car in five years. That's my hope.",
        "Yeah, I was walking down the street in my neighborhood a week ago and there was a poster on the side with like a thing was happening at a certain date and I didn't want to stop and like open my calendar app and just like put it in manually. I wanted to just like take a picture of it and have it just automatically like add my calendar invite. It knows my wife is with me, add me to it. That's kind of like the LLM world like I kind of want to live in as we kind of cross over to that point. There's a question from Jesse that I have for y'all around.",
        "per Google, AIO clicks and AI mode clicks should be aggregated into Google Search Console's overall click performance. Does anybody know how positions are factored in? My take is the resident ads person here is that Google ads used to tell you what your average position was, like 1, 1.5, 2, whatever. They got rid of that in favor of this metric called search impression share. And you have different metrics like top impression share, which means you're in the top part of the SERP.",
        "absolute top impression share, which means you're effectively number one. So my take is that we're probably going to move to some kind of metric like that, like visibility in AI mode. But what do you guys think?",
        "jump in. I actually think that like average position in Google Search Console is totally misunderstood and like very abused. Like if you actually think about, for example, you search something, you were in a country, you were using a device, that's a specific query. When you look at average position in Search Console, it's really an average of an average of an average of an average of an average. And we've gone deep down this rabbit hole because we built internal tools and we use the API.",
        "And we noticed a discrepancy between different grains. Like, are you looking at page and query? Are you pulling in country? Are you pulling in device? But the other thing is that the, lot of the time when people look at where do we rank in Google, they're counting the organic ones. Search console actually just counts everything on the page. Like I want to say even like maybe below ads, but even like, so there's a people also ask that's a thing. So you're, you're averaging across all these different dimensions.",
        "And then you're factoring all the things on the page. Like if you look at average position out of the box in Google and you compare it to like a rank tracking tool, they're totally different because U S desktop is different than averaging all the countries and all the devices. This is like a long winded tangent, but I think the point being that I wouldn't interpret that data too literally. And I think I just saw something the other day that everything within an AI overview is considered position one. But again, like who knows how that'll change and how much do we really trust Google anyway?",
        "Yeah. mean, to that point, I know we, a lot of us are accountable to higher ups that have expectations when it comes to performance metrics and ROI and showing that we're not just like doing arts and crafts around here. But like the reality is we do need to start to shift the way we think about reporting on organic search, you know, and, kind of going back to what Josh was saying about like conversions, ultimately, like if we move with AI mode, if it's a probabilistic outcome.",
        "and it's different every time, how valuable is that type of metric anyway? Like how valuable is it to know that, you know, out of a thousand searches, you get a certain percentage to what Nick was saying of like, you know, the top visibility or the bottom visibility or, know, like, what does that matter? I think it ultimately comes down to visibility in general. We do want to kind of track it, but we want to focus more on tying it to business revenue.",
        "Um, and then the other thing we haven't really even gotten into this conversation is just how the organic search as a channel, um, and the founder at Apple rank, Mike King talks about this a lot has moving from a performance channel to a brand channel. So that changes the thought process as well as like, you know, our exercises, what we're doing is SEO, organic search, visibility in these channels supports all of your other marketing efforts.",
        "So that as long as you're doing all of your other marketing and people are going to AI mode to find you, that's going to be a better outcome for what you're doing as a marketer. But we really do need to start thinking about how we're reporting on all this differently. And that's what Profound's working on. mean, Josh, you could probably speak to",
        "Yeah, there was a great study by Siege Media, too, before Josh, real quick, that just talked about if you show up in AI overviews, that depending if you're B2B or B2C, you see between a 10 to 17 % lift in branded homepage traffic to your site. I'll drop this link in the chat. But that is an interesting shift of branded searches, direct visits kind of increasing as a result of people having much higher up the funnel first touch visits with.",
        "Google AI mode, for example.",
        "Yeah, I feel like predicting this kind of stuff is like, there's this cross section of like, what is possible eventually to model and predict and then what is like reasonable and like productive. Like it reminds me of the, it's, I think I told you about this one, Nick, where it's like the meme of like two ends of the bell curve, where it's like you've got the kind of the idiot on one end, you got the genius on the other.",
        "And they're both like, yeah, just track like the main query. Like it's going to be fine. And then you got the guy in the middle who's just like stressing. He's like, but you've got to get every possible variation of persona and every possible like user background and every personality and every like geo. It's like, I think at a certain level, they're, just, there's going to be this kind like particle physics, kind of like, just like fluid dynamics thing of like.",
        "At a certain point within AI mode and these AI tools, you're going to be optimizing for like, if you really want to go to like the most granular level, you're going to be optimizing for like four ladies named Cindy in like Southern Tallahassee, which like you can like hats off, like, like go ahead. But I mean, it's going to be, you know, I think every search is going to be different. And I think there's just going to be a level where it's productive enough to just get the aggregate of whatever that unit is. and, and being in the discussion at some point is going to seed enough visibility.",
        "is going to get you in enough of these prompts, enough of these discussions to move those metrics in the right direction. like, are we going to be able to say your position too, for the keyword like beach? I don't know. I don't think that's going to happen anymore.",
        "is we kind of go down this AI search path where right now user experience and human experience is very much a thing. And what we've seen on our own profound site is that OpenAI is hitting our site 12 times as much as Googlebot. Some of that is a function of how big your site is. But I have to imagine even big sites, OpenAI is probably just slamming until they start caching some of the results that they hit.",
        "Is there a world like, you know, maybe a few years down the road, maybe sooner where it's more about an agent experience instead of like a human experience, even like website design, like visual design might become less important. And, you optimize towards like truly how well is your site optimized for agents instead.",
        "It'll be both. It'll be both. mean, you already see like a lot of the talk about the MCP, context protocols where there's more complex sites, marketplaces are building the ability to interact with their sites too. And even that was another thing that Google rolled out at IOWAS, the idea to buy products on the SERPs. I think that we're going to see this differentiation where you have to support both",
        "types of experiences. the one hand, you might not be creating content specifically for organic visibility. It might be for your other channels, but still lives on your site as a hub, as a homepage. Whereas you also want to have this like going back to the structured data and all the data in merchant center or all these other feeds that makes it as easy as possible to purchase. I mean, we see the partnership with Shopify and OpenAI in terms of like that ability.",
        "We also like, have to think about the different industries and business models too. Like I don't want to say media publishing is dead, but like it over the years, like it's been hit so many times to the business model that we're going to see so much moving behind a paywall because of, you know, protecting intellectual property. so in that sense, organic search won't be kind of a channel they'll even want to focus on. So maybe it becomes only an e-commerce focus.",
        "Everything's going to shift. just need to try your best to prepare for how user be, how are people going to interact with their various kind of devices to find your business or your content or your service, whatever.",
        "Yeah, I don't have much to add to that. The only thing I would add is if you think about like everyone's been pumping out content in similar templates, because that's what Google incentivized. And now we're moving to a point where like, think people sort of have pattern recognition to that. They're burned out on it. And when you actually do get a visitor, you don't want to F it up and you want to put a strong foot forward. So I think if we lean too much into the like, it's all agents, man. I mean, are we going to get to that point? Maybe I don't know. We're very far from it. So",
        "I agree totally with Garret. Like you want to make the content as accessible to agents and bots and whatever. But the end of the day, if you want to get in front of someone and make an impression on them, then you have to think about like, there's actually design is a great level up right now, because if people are used to so much of the same looking stuff, if you can actually differentiate, then like the bar is high to get someone to stick around. Like think about how many searches y'all do every day on chat, jbt, Google, whatever. How often do you stick around on a website? It either has to be",
        "Performing like a very strong utility for you or it has to really like suck you in with the overall experience So you have to crush one or both of those. That's my",
        "Well said. Yeah, I like that. I buy into this idea of like, there's two tiers. There's like, I buy into this like two tier of the internet idea of like, I want to see more beautiful web pages. I want to see artistic websites, cool websites, websites that are terribly optimized for bot pickup because underneath those sites are longer LLMs.txt files. I don't know, call it you want. It's longer context, know, bigger amounts of information that like the information chunking, you know,",
        "you know, vicious AI machines of the world, they're just going to inhale like vacuum cleaners and just be able to populate to people and then direct them to the cool front end, the videos, the interesting content, the multimodal stuff that actually lives for the people. I actually think this is going to be a really great change for user experience, letting people do what they want to do on their websites, letting people be creative, letting people do all this. I work with, like architecture firms come to profound and they're like, yeah, we like, we call our blog like.",
        "Like the, like the hub space zone. I'm like, and whatever, it's not actually that, but it's like some weird abstract name, not a blog. And then I'm like, like, that's rough. Like, because we really need to like call it the blog so that like the LLMs and answer engines kind of know, you know, when they're scraping that page, it's going to be a good, like normal page to scrape. they're like, yeah, we do like, kind of this like, like kind of cipher code thing with our title tags. I'm like, that's interesting too. but I want them to do that. I just want them to be able to do that. Like there, there's no reason why.",
        "With the advent of answer engines, we have to continue on that same paradigm. So I'm really excited for what the future holds.",
        "Yeah, two quick call outs to Josh's point is one, that's such a good point that just the user experience, like, even if it's frustrating for us as businesses, I think users win with all the development of this technology. We're at a nascent stage, so there are going to be a lot of problems. There going to be a lot of bad results. There are going to be a lot of bad UX experiences, but I think we'll get there. The other thing to Nigel's point is that the tools, I know there's some people who are anti generative AI for content creation or whatever, but like,",
        "The tools are also going to get better too. And we're going to be able to create some amazing things. If that isn't like your natural skill set. Like I just think human creativity is at like a starting point where there's a certain democratization, which I know there are reasons ethically that it's problematic, but for the sheer like fun creation, I get really excited.",
        "Yeah, Rose has a good question in the chat. And we briefly touched on this earlier. But she asks, for example, would regularly interacting with AI tools or chat bots help to encourage Google's AI mode or chat GPT to mention your brand more? My take is that no, I don't think that would be a driver. Otherwise,",
        "companies like Profound could have an outside impact on driving visibility for our customers. I will say that you probably have something hidden on your site that you're not using, and it's if you have any gated content, if you're in the B2B realm and you have this beautiful PDF document hidden behind a form that the chatbot can't access, I would look into how you would ungate that and try and serve that up to LLMs, as that's a wealth of good information that probably isn't being picked up right now.",
        "Do y'all have takes on?",
        "watching, I'm watching Josh.",
        "is two things. One is don't ever get caught in your individual, going back to the, all get the different results, like inside thing. One time I asked, uh, chat, GBT, what's the best, you know, B2B SEO agency ever. And it told me I pull rank and that's the agency I worked for. And I was like, oh, well, why'd you say that? It's like, well, I know that you're the director of marketing at IPR. So that makes you feel great. And I was like, yes, it did. But like that's.",
        "Not helpful for me. so whenever your, your interactions, like we are, you'll see like the option that whatever you're doing interacting with it is training data for the LMS. Now it's miniscule in the grand scheme of things, but there are also like, it constantly asks for feedback. Google does this as well. The thumbs up, thumbs down. And like that matters. Like every time you're giving a data point as to whether or not it's a good or bad answer, you're in essence.",
        "training and basically the fact of like how many people are training on your brand Maybe it doesn't work, you know down the line but right now every thumbs up is probably going to have a little like, know But I don't think I don't know you should spend your time like, you know Hire someone for 10 hours today to sit and do thumbs up for all that which probably would have an impact But I do think it matters",
        "I'm just imagining like, like a, like a warehouse full of servers, just clicking thumbs up on all the profound mentions in AI search. I mean, I think there's a few things there's like, there's the element of like, you'd be impacting the rag model. You probably don't even really care about the LLM. If you, if you're trying to train an LLM, you're on like a decades long journey. it's a separate one from ours, but it's, it's, it's a nice long one. I think.",
        "It's really hard to say. think the scale would have to be incredible. I think you'd have to have like an incredible scaled operation across, you know, continents and time zones and coordinated across many different factors to just like, like everything that works well and dislike everything that doesn't. Maybe that's a factor. Yeah. Anyone else?",
        "Yeah, I don't have a strong opinion on this at all. I mean, I've asked like an ML engineer this question a while ago and he said it's unlikely to work. I've heard people on the internet say it works, which makes me think it probably doesn't work. Maybe it does. I don't know. But to me, it's like, I don't mean it's in a bad way, but it's not the right question. It's like, I don't think this is the lever that's going to like give you the most bang for your buck. If you can figure out something, some weird thing that works here, I guess, go nuts. I wouldn't tell anybody though, like",
        "Keep that to yourself, take it to the bank.",
        "I think there is some element of that",
        "now. There's probably things that are working and people aren't talking about them.",
        "was just going say one thing to keep in mind, think is going back to the old school days of SEO right now is like, it's a while, while less experiment, run experiments for yourself, for your brand. you know, Nigel going back to Nigel's, it depends. Like it depends is when we talk about generalities, but when you get very specific into your niche, into your topic, into your segment, there are opportunities to experiment with different things. And if you find something that works, keep it to yourself, but figure out and double down.",
        "Yeah, true that. And if it does work, if liking something on ggbt does work and it becomes public, I promise you within six months it won't. Or it probably won't. These things have a way of like, the exploit is known, the exploit proliferates, the exploit is patched. That's the cycle of SEO.",
        "Right on. Well, hey, guys. Thank you so much for hopping on. think this will be probably the time that we start to wrap up. If there's any last minute questions in the chat, drop them now, and I'll flash what I think is the most interesting one on the screen. If you want to talk to anyone who you have seen here, Garrett at iPollRank would love to talk with you. You can find him on LinkedIn. Go search Google AI mode for iPollRank. The same for Nigel.",
        "Nigel runs organic growth marketing, would love to talk to anyone. And then if you're interested in talking with Profound and you submit a demo request, we will try. We will try very hard to get back to you in a timely manner. And yeah, please stay tuned for more news from us in the coming weeks. So if there aren't any more questions, guys, I'll let you go.

        "Define Your Industry & Topics: Start broad (e.g., \"B2B SaaS,\" \"Specialty Coffee Retail,\" \"Home Fitness Equipment\") and then pinpoint the most critical topics and queries. Think about what customers might ask an AI assistant when exploring your category, from top-of-funnel questions (\"What's the best CRM software for a small business?\") to mid-funnel queries (\"How does CRM X compare to CRM Y?\").",
        "Identify Key Influencers, Sources & Competitors: Use AI visibility tools like Profound to run dozens—or even hundreds—of queries and see which publishers and brands appear most often in AI answers. You may find unexpected outlets (e.g., a niche blog or industry newsletter) ranking higher in AI citations than established media giants.",
        "Map Content Formats That Win: Determine what type of content AI models love to cite. Are they referencing \"Top 10\" listicles, expert Q&As, product comparison tables, or in-depth how-to guides? Understanding the winning formats will guide your content strategy.",
        "Track Your Findings & Discover Patterns: Use the Google Sheet linked here to track your findings. Include the query you tested and the Answer Engine you used, and then make note of the primary citations/sources, competitors, and content formats that arise. From there, start looking for patterns. Are there unexpected sources, competitors, or content formats dominating your space? Are there specific queries you want to be sure you're dominating? A simple spreadsheet is all you need to start answering these questions. Tools like Profound are how you take it to the next level.",
        "Focus on Structure & Clarity: Use clear headings, bullet points, comparison tables, and FAQ sections. AI models thrive on well-organized information. For example, a \"Pros & Cons\" table for competing products or a \"Step-by-Step Guide\" to using your solution can be a goldmine for AI references and AI optimization.",
        "Build Comparative Content: AI answers often respond to queries like \"Which product is best?\" or \"How does A compare to B?\" Give them that comparative structure. If you're in a travel space, create \"Ultimate Comparison: 5 Family-Friendly Resorts vs. City Hotels.\" If you're in B2B SaaS, produce \"CRM Feature Comparison: A Side-by-Side Look at the Top 5 Tools.\"",
        "Include Expert Commentary & Distinctive Insights: Generative AI will value unique perspectives. If your company has subject-matter experts, feature their commentary prominently. Highlight brand values, insider tips, proprietary research, and distinct attributes that help the model understand why your brand stands out.",
        "Use Precise, Descriptive Language: Avoid jargon for jargon's sake. Focus on terms the AI can easily match to user intent. If you're describing a product's key feature, spell it out in simple terms and include context (e.g., \"Our coffee beans are single-origin Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, known for their floral aroma and blueberry undertones.\")",
        "Approach \"Hidden Influencers\": Based on your analysis from step 1, you might find that niche industry publications, research firms, or community-driven platforms like Reddit or local trade blogs have disproportionate AI citation power. Pitch your content to these sources. Offer them exclusive data, guest posts, or interviews that integrate your brand's narrative.",
        "Leverage PR & Earned Media Strategies: Traditional PR still matters. By securing placements or mentions in highly-cited outlets, you ensure your brand is part of the corpus AI models pull from. Consider partnerships, sponsored content, or editorial collaborations that highlight your structured, comparison-driven insights.",
        "Optimize Your Owned Channels: Don't rely solely on third-party publishers. Ensure your company blog, resource center, or newsroom is well-structured, easy to crawl, and updated regularly. The AI might directly reference your site if it's authoritative and well-structured.",

        "SEO: Involves influencing search engine algorithms by improving site structure, acquiring backlinks, and utilizing keywords to enhance rankings.",
        "AEO: Focuses on making content suitable for selection by AI retrieval systems. Brands don’t need to influence the LLM directly; instead, they must align content with the preferences of AI systems to increase the chances that it will be selected for AI-generated answers.",
